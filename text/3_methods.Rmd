## Online Experiment

The online survey-experiment was conducted over a period of one week. The studied subjects were chosen beforehand through dispension of digital invitations by members of the project group. This way three hundred subjects were selected. As a result of the selection method the sample reflects a very high percentage of students as well as a very low age and a political centre-left attitude on average (see below). 

The pooled subjects were randomized into three groups each receiving a different treatment in between the first and the second query of a decision in one of two ethcial dilemmas. The two different dilemmas were the described ‚trolley-problem‘ and the ‚fat man-problem‘ (see attachement for descriptions). These two dilemmas were distributed randomly among the three treatment-groups. 

It should be noted though that the randomized assignment of subjects to one of the three treatment-/control-groups was flawed. This can be derived from a comparison of the mean-values of this studies main-variables: The compared mean-values by groups for the dependent variable in dichotomous (?) and continous forms, as well as the variables for gender, age and the primary indepent variables Idealism and Relativism show some significant differences (see below). The following analysis should therefore be interpreted with caution and keep in mind possible effects of non-random group-assignment. 

Chosen subjects got to read a insertion text and had to fill in a survey regarding their general ethical position [@forsyth1980taxonomy] as well as their personality and political attitude. The they were asked to make a first decision in one of the two ethical dilemmas via dichotomous Yes/No choice and continous tendency-rating (towards intervening or staying passive). Afterwards each of the three groups received a treatment:


+ The first group, which comes closest to a ‚control group‘, had to read a short text conerning ethics (see attachement). 
+ In the second group each subject received identical utilitarian and deontological arguments. Three arguments each argued for or against an intervention in the ethical dilemmas (see attachement). 
+ The third group participated in a one-week-long asynchronous dialog on a digital platform. "Smartopinion" allowed the participants to post and comment their own arguments for or against any decision in the ethical dilemma or comment on one of 6 pro/contra-arguments (3 each utilitarian/deontological) which were posted beforehand by the project group. The discussion was moderated by project members who didn’t intervene in the dialog at any given point. 

After these treatments the subjects were once again asked for their decision in their respective ehtical dilemma in the forms of choice and rating and answered a questionnaire concerning their socio-dempographic background.

## Dataset

The resulting dataset consists of 93 variables and data from 300 subjects. The studied sample depicts a high percentage of students (approximately 92 percent) and therefore reflects a low age (24 years) a political centre-left attitude (4.7 on a scale from 1 to 10) and a relatively high political interest (3.2 on a scale from 1 to 4) on average. The exact population cannot be determined, because of arbitrary selection mechanisms within some steps of the research process (dispension of invitations, reaction to invitations etc.). The interpretation of any results from this study should therefore be carried out with caution, even with respect to the population of german students/students from Stuttgart.

## Operationialization

The factors under study were operationalized as follows: 

The dependent variable, the decision in one of two ethical dilemmas, was gathered in the form of a dichotomous choice between Interevention and Passivity and a continous tendency on a scale from 1 (Pro-Passivity) to 11 (Pro-Intervention). The main independent variables, the different ethical ideologies of the subjects under study, were gathered as german versions of the twenty ‚Ethical-Position‘-items originally developed by Forsyth [-@forsyth1980taxonomy]. 

These items ask the respondent for their reaction to ethical statements concerning one of the two dimensions (Idealism and Relativism) identified by Forsyth, on a scale from 1 ‚Completely disagree‘ to 9 ‚Completely agree‘ [@forsyth1980taxonomy: 178].

One example for such a (Idealism-)statement is:

> "A person should make certain that their actions never intentionally harm another even to a small degree" [@forsyth1980taxonomy: 178].

The used translation of the ‚Ethical Position Questionnaire‘ was taken from Strack and Gennerich [-@strack2007erfahrung: 13] (see attachement). To validate and extract the two dimensions, ‚Idealism‘ and ‚Relativism‘, from the data, a Explorative Factor Analysis (Principal Component Analysis) was conducted and indices, each consisting of their dimensions 10 variables, were formed (see below). The selected control variables were age (continuous), gender (dichotomous) and frequency of church attendance from 1 ‚More than once a week‘ to 6 ‚Never‘.

## Factor Analysis

In order to validate the two dimensions Idealism and Relativism, from the Ethical Positions Questionnaire, a factor analysis with the rotation method varimax was performed.

\end{figure}



The factor analysis (Figure 1) shows that the variables of the ethical positions questionaire load very well without any cross-loads (cut off value: 0.40). Only the loading of eqp11 is too low (-0.12) to take into account. With the remaining variables the variables Idealism and Relativism were created.


## Randomization and Descriptive Statistics

This section will introduce some basic descriptive statistics of the used variables. (Summary Statistics as footnote & appendix?...). Figure 2 shows a comparison between the experimental groups by age, gender, Idealism and Relativism. As mentioned before, the randomization of the groups was flawed. Regarding the comparison between the experimental groups by age and gender, the differences are significant. The control group has a women proportion of over 52%, whereas only 41% of the discussion group are women. In addition, there is a strong outlier in the control group with over 50 years in the age.

Moreover, there are also significant differences between the experimental groups regarding the main independent variables Idealism and Relativism. Concerning this issue, the following analysis should be interpreted with caution. When it comes to the question of whether it is morally justifiable to switch the track or even push a person, there are differences in age and gender (see Figure 3).

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}

Older people as well as female persons consider both scenarios less morally justified. A comparison of the means, regarding the gender, the differences between men and women are clearly significant in both scenarios. However, comparing the two scenarios shows that switching tracks is more likely to be morally justified than pushing a person.
