The following Chapter \ref{theory} discusses our theoretical framework and classification of European populist parties, as well as some of the general challenges when it comes to quantifying and analyzing populism in Europe. In Chapter \ref{methods}, the used research methods are introduced and the classification of European parties is done with the help of k-means clustering. Afterwards, Chapter \ref{analysis} reports on the multinomial logistic regression and its results. Finally, the conclusion (Chapter \ref{conclusion}) gives a summary of the results and derives implications for further research.
